<em>This library contains implementations of common computer vision
algorithms, with a special focus on visual features for matching image
regions. Applications include structure from motion, object and
category detection, object and category recognition.</em>

@section main-design Library design

@subsection main-design-goals Goals

The goal of the VLFeat core library is to provide solid
implementations a small set of useful computer vision algorithms. The
libary targets are computer vision researchers. The library aims to
be:

- <b>Accurate</b>. Algorithms should be well defined and (when
  possible) close to the description/implementation of the original
  authors.
 
- <b>Easy to use</b>. The library should be easy to compile and
  setup. The user interface should be simple and flexible. The
  documentation should be clear and complete.
 
- <b>Open</b>. The code should be easy to read, understand and modify.
  It should also be easy to extract from the library a particular
  algorithm.

Speed is not our main concern, even if we are happier with fast
implementations.

@subsection main-design-guidelines Guidelines

In order to obtain an accurate, usable and open library, the code is
written according to the following guidelins:

- <b>Minimality</b>. The core library includes only the fundamental
  algorithms. Additional functionalities are either included in the
  MATLAB toolbox (part of VLFeat) or left to the user. This redueces
  clutter and makes the library manageable by the authors.
- <b>Flatness</b>. The intra-dependencies among library modules are
  not deep.  In most cases, an algorithm implementation depends only
  on a few basic modules (such as IO or math operations), but is
  otherwise largely independent from other algorithms. This simplifies
  isolating an algorithm from the library.
- <b>Portability</b>. The library is in standard C (fundamentally
  C-89, with a few exceptions) and has no external dependencies except for
  the basic ones. This also makes easier to compile the library.
- <b>Slef-documented</b>. Documentation is embedded in the source code
  in Doxygen format. The documentation includes exhaustive
  descriptions of each algorithm.

@subsection main-design-style Coding style

This section describes the coding style we use for the libary.


@subsection main-design-style Memory management

Memory is allocated and freed by means of ::vl_malloc(), vl_free(),
::vl_realloc() functions, which are stubs pointing to the actual
function to use. So when the library is linked to a MATLAB MEX file,
it is possible to use MATLAB memory allocation functions instead of the
operating system ones. The advantage is that MATLAB memory handler
will free the allocated buffers in the case a MEX file is interrupted
(Ctl-C).

This also requires a bit of care to work as intended:

- The library must be thread safe.

- Objects must have allocation and de-allocation methods. Garbage collection 
  (e.g. MATLAB exiting a MEX file) can be performed only after 
  all objects have been deleted. So in effect garbage collection is useful
  only to clean-up after an interrupted computation.

- Static objects are not safe as they would violate the garbage collection rule.
  For instance, one should not alocate static buffers in functions, as
  the buffer could be stealed by sucessive garbage collection.

@section main-glossary Glossary

- <b>Column-major.</b> A <em>M x N </em> matrix <em>A</em> is
stacked with column-major order as the sequence \f$(A_{11}, A_{21},
\dots, A_{12}, \dots)\f$. More in general, when stacking a multi
dimensional array this indicates that the first index is the one
varying most quickly, with the other followed in the natural order.

- <b>Opaque structure.</b> A structure is opaque if its fields are not
meant to be accessed directly but by means of appropriate interface
functions. This techniuqe improves robustness and and isolates the
implementation from the interface, much in the spirit of
object-oriented programming.

- <b>Row-major.</b> A <em>M x N </em> matrix <em>A</em> is
stacked with row-major order as the sequence \f$(A_{11}, A_{12},
\dots, A_{21}, \dots)\f$. More in general, when stacking a multi
dimensional array this indicates that the last index is the one
varying most quickly, with the other followed in reverse order.

 ** @brief  Generic

This module provides basic facilities such as atomi types definitions,
error handling, endianness detection, serialization, logging.

@section generic-error Error handling

Error handling uses the same style of the standard C library. Most
functions return 0 when they succeed and -1 when they fail, and
set the global variable ::vl_err_no with a code identifying the
error occurred. This variable is never set on success and should
be examinated right after an error occurred.

@section generic-endian Endinanness detection and conversions

An architecture is big endiand or little endian depending how
multi-btye data are stored in memory:

- <em>big endian</em> (big end first - Network order) if it
  stores the most significant byte has the smaller memory address.
- <em>little endian</em> (small end first - Intel format) if it
  stores the lesser significant byte at the smaller memory address.

Use the function ::vl_get_endianness() to detect endianness.  To
serialize/deserialize data in big endian (network) order, call the
functions ::vl_adapt_endianness_8(), ::vl_adapt_endianness_4(),
::vl_adapt_endianness_2() after reading and before writing (the
functions change edinanness only if the architecture is little
endian and do nothing otherwise).
