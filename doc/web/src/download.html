<h1 id="download.install">Installation</h1>
<p>
Installing VLFeat is very simple. After downloading and unpacking the most
recent binary package (see above), follow these instructions:
</p>

<p>
To use the <b>MATLAB Toolbox</b>, simply run the <code>vlfeat_setup</code> command found in the <code>vlfeat/toolbox</code> directory. This command adds the necessary paths to MATLAB search path list. Notice that the paths are not saved. To automate this step, you can add the following fragment of code to your MATLAB <code>startup.m</code> file (on UNIX based system this file is located in <code>~/matlab/</code>, where <code>~</code> denotes your home directory):
</p>

<p>
<pre>
p=pwd ;
cd PATHTOVLFEAT ;
cd toolbox ;
vlfeat_setup
cd(p) ;
clear p
</pre>
</p>

<p>
To install the <b>command line utilities</b>, copy the appropriate files from the
<code>vlfeat/bin</code> directory to a location in your command path.
</p>

<p>
Finally, to use the <b>C library</b> in your programs, include the appropriate files from the <code>vlfeat/vl</code> hierarchy and link against <code>libvl.a</code> located in the appropriate subdirectory in the <code>vlfeat/bin</code> hierarchy.
</p>

<h1 id="download.compile">Compiling VLFeat</h1>
<p><b>Note: Compiling is not necessary if you make use of the binary distribution.</b></p>

<p>
For <b>UNIX</b> based platforms (Mac OS X and Linux), the library bundles a GNU-Make makefile (<code>vlfeat/makefile</code>). The makefile tries to auto-detect the environment and automatically configure itself. In most cases, typing <code>make</code> is all it is required to compile everything. If this does not work, please edit the makefile and make the necessary adjustment to the flags. The required changes should be obvious.
</p>

<p>
For <b>Windows</b>, the library bundles a NMake makefile. To use it, run the Visual C command line console and type <code>nmake</code>.
</p>
