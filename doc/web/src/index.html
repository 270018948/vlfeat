<p><b>VLFeat</b> is an open source collection of vision algorithms
with a special focus on visual features (SIFT, MSER, ...). It bundles
a MATLAB toolbox, a clean and portable C library and a number of
command line utilities. Thus it is possible to use the same algorithm
both from MATLAB, the command line, and your own programs.</p>

<p>VLFeat is an effort initiated by Andrea Vedaldi and Brian Fulkerson
in 2007.</p>

<h2>Obtaining VLFeat</h2>

<p>You can download the <a href="download">binary distribution<a> (Mac, Linux,
Windows) or the <a href="code">source code</a>.</p>

<p>There are no special installation instructions: simply unpack the
archive. To use the MATLAB Toolbox, open MATLAB, cd into
the <code>toolbox</code> subdirectory and exectue
the <code>vlfeat_setup</code> command. Use
the <code>overview_vlfeat</code> command to print a summary of the
toolbox contents.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>

<p>To start using the MATLAB toolbox, you can read the <a href="mdoc">list
of toolbox functions</a>. To use the C library please refer to
the <a href="api">C library documentation</a>. Finally, to use the
command line utilities, refer to the relative <a href="man">manual
pages</a>.</p>

<p>
Notice that the authoritative description of the algorithms is
contained in the C library documentation. Reading this material is
generally not required to use the library from MATLAB or the command
line, but it can be useful to understand the meaning of the algorithm
parameters and have accurate informations on their
implementations.</p>
