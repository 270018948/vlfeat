<p></b>VLFeat</b> offers a hierarchical version of integer k-means, which
recusively apply \cmd{ikmeans} to compute finer and finer partitions.
We demonstrates this by:</p>
<pre>
K        = 3 ;
nleaves  = 100 ;
data     = uint8(rand(2,10000) * 255) ;
datat    = uint8(rand(2,100000)* 255) ;
[tree,A] = hikmeans(data,K,nleaves) ;
AT       = hikmeanspush(tree,datat) ;
</pre>

<p>Here <code>nleaves</code> is the desired number of leaf
clusters. This is obtained by subdividing recursively each cluster in
k sub-clusters. Therefore <code>depth = floor(log(K nleaves))</code>
recursive subdivisons are sufficient and the algorithm terminates with
clusters arranged in a k-tree of of depth
<code>depth</code> which has at least <code>nleaves</code> leaves (but
it may have more).</p>

<div class="caption"></b>Hierarchical integer K-means.</b>  Left: A
depiction of the rescursive clsuters. Each node is a cluster
center. The root note is not depicted (its center would be the mean of
the dataset).  Right: Clusters are represented as different colors
(here are more thatn 100 clusters, but only tree colors are
used).</div>
</div>

<p>The output <code>tree</code> is a MATLAB structure representing the tree of
clusters:<p>

<pre>
> tree
tree =
 
          K: 3
      depth: 5
    centers: [2x3 int32]
        sub: [1x3 struct]
</pre>

<p>The field <code>centers</code> is the matrix of the cluster centers at the
root node.  If the depth of the tree is larger than 1, then the field
<code>sub</code> is a structure array with one entry for each cluster. Each
element is in turn a structure such as</p>

<pre>
> tree.sub
ans = 

1x3 struct array with fields:
    centers
    sub
</pre>

<p>with the cluster centers for that recusrive parittions and a field
\verb$sub$ for the recursive children. When there are no childrent,
this field is equal to the empty matrix</p>

<pre>
K>> tree.sub(1).sub(1).sub(1).sub(1)

ans = 

    centers: [2x3 int32]
        sub: []
</pre>
