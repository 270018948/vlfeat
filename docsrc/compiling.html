<p>These instructions explain how to compile VLFeat on your own. This
can be useful to customize or contribute to VLFeat, but it is
otherwise not necessary (<b>use the
<a href="%pathto:download;">binary package</a> instead</b>).</p>

<p>For <b>UNIX</b> based platforms (Mac OS X and Linux), the library
 bundles a GNU makefile (<code>Makefile</code>). The makefile
 tries to auto-detect the environment and automatically configure
 itself. In most cases, typing <code>make</code> is all it is required
 to compile everything. If this does not work, please edit the
 makefile and make the necessary adjustment to the flags.</p>

<p>For <b>Windows</b>, the library bundles a NMake makefile
 (<code>Makefile.mak</code>). In order to use it, you must open
 Makefile.mak and adjust the values of configuration variables to match
 your setup. Once you have done that, start the Visual Studio Command
 Prompt and type <code>nmake /f Makefile.mak</code>.</p>

<p><b>Note: For Windows you can also just compile the mex files.</b> Start with
 our binary distribution.</p>

<p><b>Windows: Troubleshooting common problems:</b></p>
<dl>
 <dt>syntax error: '=' unexpected:</dt>
 <dd><p>Use <code>nmake /f Makefile.mak</code>.
   Without <code>/f</code>, nmake will default to the wrong
   makefile.</p></dd>
 <dt>'long' followed by 'long' is illegal:</dt>
 <dd><p>This error is usually caused by
   attempting to compile outside of the Visual Studio Command Prompt.</p></dd>

<p><b>Compiling for Snow Leopard (64-bit) and MATLAB 2009b:</b> MATLAB 2009b for Snow Leopard has added 64 bit mex support and the extension mexmaci64. VLFeat now supports compiling for this platform, but the architecture must be specified manually when compiling, either like:

<pre>
MEX=/Applications/MATLAB_R2009b.app/bin/mex ARCH=maci64 NDEBUG=y make
</pre>

<pre>
MEX=/Applications/MATLAB_R2009b.app/bin/mex ARCH=maci NDEBUG=y make
</pre>

Unfortunately, MATLAB 2009b has a bug in inclued the mex script, so if you wish to compile yourself, you will need to modify it. We recommend making a backup before making any changes to this file. To fix the bug, you need to cut this line:

<pre>
get_arch    # Call $MATLAB/bin/util/arch.sh  
</pre>

and paste it after the processing of options:

<pre>
...
shift
done

#PASTE get_arch call here
get_arch    # Call $MATLAB/bin/util/arch.sh

if [ $v7_compat -eq 1 ] ; then
fc_flags="$fc_flags -DMX_COMPAT_32"
...
</pre>
</p>
