alt="PASCAL2 credits"></img> In 2012 the development of VLFeat is
sponsored by the PASCAL Harvest Programme. Many hours of coding went
into the project by several new contributors. The novel developments
will be made public in the next several weeks as the code is tuned and
tested.</p>

<p>A particularly signifcant achievement is the creation of a new
subroject, <b>VLBenchmakrs</b>, for the evaluation of feature
detecrtors and descriptors. <b>VLBenchmarks</b> is meant to provide a
future-proof benchmarking suite. The first release includes
reimplementations of standard feature benchmarks to replace aging
legacy code and a brand new benchmark. In the future, it will be used
to deliver to the community new, modern benchmarks in a consistent and
simple to use pacakge.</p>

<h4>Version 0.9.18 (predicted January)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Large scale Approximate Nearest Neighbours (ANN) K-means.</li>
<li>Large scale ANN Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs).</li>
<li>Fisher Kernel encoding.</li>
<li>Locality Linear Coding (LLC).</li>
</ul>

<h4>Version 0.9.17 (predicted end November)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Local Ternary Patterns (LTP).</li>
<li>Local Binary Patterns (LBP).</li>
</ul>

<h4>Version 0.9.16 (predicted early October)</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>VLBenchmarks</b>: detector repeatability, descriptor matching
score, and image retrieval benchmarks.</li>
<li>Affine covariant feature detectors. The aim is to create a future
proof replacement of
the <a href='http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/affine/'>legacy
implementation</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Version 0.9.15 (released)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features.</li>
<li>New Stochatstic Gradient Descent (SGD) Support Vector Machine
(SVM) implementation. Layed down a good infrasructure to add mroe
learning algorithms in the future.</li>
<li>Several utility functions (hashed summation, integral images,
plotting functions).</li>
<li>Significant cleanup of the codebase, outsdanding bugs
squashed.</li>
<li>Created the VLFeat Team for a more open development.</li>
</ul>
