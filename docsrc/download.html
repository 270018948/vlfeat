 <h1 id="download.install">Installation</h1>

 <p>Installing VLFeat is very simple. After downloading and unpacking
  the most recent binary package (see above), follow these
  instructions (each item can be installed independently):</p>

 <dl>
  <dt>MATLAB Toolbox</dt>
  <dd>
   <p>
    Run the <code>vl_setup</code> command found in
    the <code>vlfeat/toolbox</code> directory. This command adds the
    necessary paths to MATLAB search path list.
   </p>

   <p>Notice that the paths are not saved. To automate this step, you
    can add the following fragment of code to your
    MATLAB <code>startup.m</code> file (on UNIX based system this file is
    located in <code>~/matlab/</code>, where <code>~</code> denotes your
    home directory):</p>

   <pre>
    p=pwd ;
    cd PATHTOVLFEAT ;
    cd toolbox ;
    vl_setup
    cd(p) ;
    clear p
   </pre>

   <p>Alternatively, you can use 
    <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=site:www.mathworks.com+savepath&amp;btnI=I">MATLAB
     <code>savepath</code> command</a> to save the updated search
    paths.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Command line utilities</dt>
  <dd>
   <p>
    Copy the content of the directory <code>vlfeat/bin/X</code> to a
    location in your operating system command search
    path. Here <code>X</code> denotes the subdirectory relative to
    your architecture (e.g. <code>mac</code> for Mac OS X
    PPC, <code>maci</code> for Mac OS X Intel,
   <code>glx</code> for Linux, and so on).
  </p>
 </dd>

 <dt>
 <dt>C library</dt>
 <dd>
  <p>Include in you C source code the appropriate files from
   the <code>vlfeat/vl</code> hierarchy and link against the
   library <code>vl</code> located the appropriate
   subdirectory <code>vlfeat/bin/X</code>, where <code>X</code>
   depends on your architecture and is defined above. The exact steps
   (and file names) depend on the architecture and compiler that you
   are using.</p>
 </dd>
 </dt>
</dl>

<h1 id="download.compile">Compiling VLFeat</h1>

<p><b>Note: Compiling is not necessary if you make use of the binary
  distribution.</b></p>

<p>For <b>UNIX</b> based platforms (Mac OS X and Linux), the library
 bundles a GNU-Make makefile (<code>Makefile</code>). The makefile
 tries to auto-detect the environment and automatically configure
 itself. In most cases, typing <code>make</code> is all it is required
 to compile everything. If this does not work, please edit the makefile
 and make the necessary adjustment to the flags.</p>

<p>For <b>Windows</b>, the library bundles a NMake makefile
 (<code>Makefile.mak</code>). In order to use it, you must open
 Makefile.mak and adjust the values of configuration variables to match
 your setup. Once you have done that, start the Visual Studio Command
 Prompt and type <code>nmake /f Makefile.mak</code>.</p>

<p><b>Note: For Windows you can also compile only the mex files.</b> Start with
 our binary distribution.</p>

<p><b>Windows: Troubleshooting common problems:</b></p>
<dl>
 <dt>syntax error: '=' unexpected:</dt>
 <dd><p>Use <code>nmake /f Makefile.mak</code>.
   Without <code>/f</code>, nmake will default to the wrong
   makefile.</p></dd>
 <dt>'long' followed by 'long' is illegal:</dt>
 <dd><p>This error is usually caused by
   attempting to compile outside of the Visual Studio Command Prompt.</p></dd>
</dl>
