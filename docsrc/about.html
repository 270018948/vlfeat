<p><b>VLFeat</b> is a cross-platform open source collection of vision
algorithms with a special focus on visual features (for instance SIFT
and MSER) and clustering (k-means, hierarchical k-means, agglomerative
information bottleneck). It bundles a MATLAB toolbox, a clean and
portable C library and a number of command line utilities. Thus it is
possible to use the same algorithm both from MATLAB, the command line,
and your own programs.</p>

<p><b>VLFeat</b> is an effort initiated by Andrea Vedaldi and Brian
Fulkerson in 2007, based on previously published sowftware from the
same authors.</p>
