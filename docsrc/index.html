<p><b>VLFeat</b> is a cross-platform open source collection of vision algorithms
with a special focus on visual features (SIFT, MSER) and clustering (k-means,
hierarchical k-means, agglomerative information bottleneck). It bundles
a MATLAB toolbox, a clean and portable C library and a number of
command line utilities. Thus it is possible to use the same algorithm
both from MATLAB, the command line, and your own programs.</p>

<p>VLFeat is an effort initiated by Andrea Vedaldi and Brian Fulkerson
in 2007.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>

<p>VLFeat can be obtained <a href="download">here</a>. To start using
the MATLAB toolbox, you can read some of
the <a href="tut">tutorials</a> and the <a href="mdoc">list of
MATLAB functions</a>. To learn about the C library interface and
details of the implemented algorithms, please refer to
the <a href="api">C library documentation</a>. Finally, to use the
command line utilities, please refer to the
relative <a href="man">manual pages</a>.</p>
