<p><b>VLFeat</b> is a MATLAB-compatible implementation common computer
vision algorithms such
as <em>SIFT</em>, <em>MSER</em>, <em>k-means</em>, <em>hierarchical
k-means</em>, and <em>agglomerative information bottleneck</em>.</p>

<p><b>VLFeat</b> is easily portable and supports natively <em>Mac OS
X</em>, <em>Linux</em>, and <em>Windows</em>.</p>

<p><b>VLFeat</b> is <em>open source</em> software released under the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html">GNU

<h2 style="clear:both;" id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>

<p>You can obtain <b>VLFeat</b> source code or precompiled binaries
from <a href="download">here</a>. To start using the MATLAB toolbox,
you can read some of the <a href="tut">tutorials</a> and have a look
at the <a href="mdoc">list of MATLAB functions</a>.</p>

<p>Some algorithms (SIFT and MSER) have command line interfaces as
well (which do not require MATLAB). To learn about the command line
utilities please refer to the relative <a href="man">manual
pages</a>.</p>

<p>The core of VLFeat is a clean C library. To learn about the C API
and the details of the implemented algorithms, please refer to
the <a href="api">C library documentation</a>.</p>
