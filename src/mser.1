.SH OVERVIEW
.B mser
computes the Maximally Stalbe Extremal Regions (MSER) of an image.
The command is quite flexible: it can operate on multiple images at
once and it exposes many parameters of the MSER algorithm.
.SH SPECIFYING FILES
In order to make it easy to work with multiple input files,
.B sift
makes uses of file specifiers. A file specifier
.I spec
specifies the format of the file and how its name has to be derived
from the name of the input file. The format may be either binary (
.I bin:
) or ASCII (
.I ascii:
). File in binary format are vectors of homogeneous atomic values
(such as doubles and bytes) and they are always in big-endian
ordering. 
.P
The file name is derived from a pattern by substituting any occurence
of the wildcard character `%' (the wildcard character can be escaped
by preceding it by `\\') with the basename of the input file. For
instance, the specifier
.I bin:/tmp/%.sift
with input file
.I myimage.pgm
correspond to the file
.I /tmp/myyimage.sift
in binary format.
